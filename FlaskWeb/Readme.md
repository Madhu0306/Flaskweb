# Introduction

In this section of the course, the goal is to learn and understand more about web development with Python using Flask microframework.
We will rebuild this [learning diary](https://www.python0to1.club/) page from scratch.
Please note that this project is not focusing on UI/UX design, therefore the front-end design is very minimum.
- Front-end: [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
- Back-end: [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- Database: [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
